      "name": "Island More",
      "description": "This is a conglomeration of a number of islands very connected, including Rabbit Island to the NW, Knocky Cahillaun and Freaghillan to the NE, and mighty Clynish to the E. The centre is at the gap with Knocky Cahillaun where there are half a dozen houses. A laneway though the gap is an important thoroughfare hereabouts, certainly a significant portage in an area where these things matter. The houses are well appointed, money no object. The ridge walking either side of the gap is gorgeous. Rabbit L902-897 is also joined to Inishbee / Derinish, and nowadays is an absentee cattle ranch. There is also a posh quay / pontoon on the spit joining to Quinnsheen Island at about L909-891. Most remarkable is the fine path created from the pontoon to the nearest house, across unstable storm beach. The house is old, with old vegetation, there a long time. Even more so, view the Steamship wrecked in Island More Harbour, called the Charles Stewart Parnell. She caught fire while at anchor there, and was lost with no casualties. She is famous for the enormous lobster living in her boiler, who has been trapped there the last 30+ years, as it grew too big to escape!",

      "name": "Bray Head",
      "description": "Bray Head is a mountain with twin peaks. The more northerly, 206m high peak has a prominent cross on top. The higher, 240m peak is to the S. At shore level, there are two roughly equivalent headlands, Bray Head at O286-170 and Cable Rock at O290-156. Cable Rock is a pronounced headland with an off-lying rock. There are large seabird colonies on the head in the breeding season. Swell develops if there are sustained or strong winds from N, E or S, and gives difficult conditions all along the headland from the promenade in Bray to Cable Rock. The sea frequently breaks over Cable Rock, 80m off the headland. The tide flows strongly through the gap. Beware of a deeper rock, about 50m off the shore, which breaks the lower half of the tide in bad conditions. The sea state off Bray Head is almost always more severe than on the adjoining coast. Rogue waves are not unusual. This is not a place to go swimming, as the escape routes are tricky, the few storm beaches having dumping surf. This whole 3km section is a fine paddle, very scenic, the slopes of Bray Head rising above, and the cliffs at the water’s edge a modest rock-climbing haven. Look for the climbing cliffs just N of the Cable Rock headland. They are identified by the metal spikes in the steep ground in the first 20m above HW where the railway tunnel opens. There are three landable storm beaches on the head, but they are exposed and steep, or even missing, at HW. Above them runs the railway line, which was engineered out of the cliff with great difficulty in the mid 19th Century. The most convenient embarkation point in Bray is at the extreme S end of the promenade at O276-179, closest to the head.

South of Greystones, one is unsheltered from ebb or flood and this stretch is a sustained hard battle if against the tide.",

    "name": "Carrig Island",
    "description": "The S/SW side of the island is joined to the mainland by a small bridge and a spit of marshy, grassy land, covered only by high spring tides. Carrig also has an inhabited farm and a Napoleonic battery at Q977-486 on the NW. The population is 13. The major attraction is the well-preserved Carrigafoyle Castle on the SE. The castle is more accessible from the water. Land at HW to avoid mud flats. The castle is a most interesting waystop, not to be missed by the passer-by. Thought to have been impregnable by 16th Century standards, and in 1580 Lord Pelham wasn’t convinced, and he was proved right. Military design quickly moved towards curved walls as a result.
