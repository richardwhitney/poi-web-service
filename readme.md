# POI-Core

This project was developed as part of my assignment work for 
Enterprise Web Development. The brief was to develop a web app
that allows users to view and created Points of Interests (POI).
A point of interest, or POI, is a specific point location that someone may find
useful or interesting. I chose to focus on the islands of Ireland for this project.
